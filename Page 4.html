    There are many diffrent types of meat out there on the market that people love and enjoy. The meats that you learned about in this website are me and some of my freinds personal favorites. You may not like these meats as much as we do, But we are just trying to teach people about meat so that when you order a nice juicy steak at a restaurant, you know what you are ordering and where it came from.
